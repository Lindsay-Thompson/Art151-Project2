    <h1>Trouble on the Horizon</h1>
    <p>Ye scrubbed the deck, served the meat and rum.
        A long day's work to prove your worth to sea
        Dogs old and young.  Up on the crow's nest ye
        look through your spyglass and see a horrid site.
        A british ship, lo!  The Arrow! Headed straight for thee!
        Hurry down scallwag! And waste no time!
        Warn Captain Mumford to save your behinds!
        Or, drink some more and lighten up, you've had
        A long first day.  The Scurvvy Kitten will
        survive, with a scrappy hard crew as this!</p>



<p>Do ye
<a href="youwarnedcaptainmumford.html">Tell Captain Mumford that there is another British ship approaching</a><br>
<a href="killedinaction.html">Ignore the ship and get back to drinkin</a>
