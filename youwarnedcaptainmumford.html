<h1>The Real Captain Mumford</h1>

<p>A dark look overtakes Captain Mumford.  He turns his back to open a chest in his cabin.<br>
He dons a black hat and turns around, with only murder in his eyes.  On his black hat is a golden crescent, of a one eyed cat skull and two dead fish<br>
This isn't a merchant ship...This the wretched pirate ship Scurvvy Kitten, and this kindly merchant is none other than the<br>
scourge of the seven seas himself...Captain Mumford.
<hr />
<p>Captain Mumford respects your cleverness and your daring.<br>He offers you the opportunity to swear<br>
allegience to him and the Scurvy Kitten.  You will be a member of his crew, and share in the plunder</p>
<hr />
<p>Do you<br>
    <a href="youfightthebritish.html">Help the Scurvy Kitten attack the British ship</a><br>
        <a href="killedinaction.html">a false promise to Captain Mumford, and betray the crew during the attack</a></p>
